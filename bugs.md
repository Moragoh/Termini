## Terminal shows weird output by default.
The terminal looks like this even when I didn't type anything.
junminkim@macbookpro / % [?2004h

It shows up whenever I input a command to. For instance, when I type the clear command, I see this gibberish
junminkim@macbookpro / % [?2004hcclear[?2004l

%
